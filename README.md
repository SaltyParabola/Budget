# Budget
Simple budget program with a concept similar to EveryDollar and Goodbudget, but totally free and it tracks total money rather than by month.

budget_excel.py writes the transactions to an excel file.

budget_google.py writes the transactions to a google doc. Other than that, they have basically the same functionality.

# to do

* add a GUI
* let the program write to multiple sheets without hardcoding
* maybe make a mobile app
